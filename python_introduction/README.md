# Month 1 — Work Log (Brag List) — ALX Back-End

**Period:** September 8 — September 15, 2025  
**Owner:** Amr (GitHub: @amrhazard15)

---

## 🔹 Summary (What I worked on)
- Joined ALX Back-End and completed Week 1 & Week 3 learning modules.
- Built and tested Python scripts to practice fundamentals:
  - `basic_operations.py`
  - `simple_interest.py`
  - `rectangle_area.py`
  - `hours_to_seconds.py`
  - `future_age_calculator.py`
  - `finance_calculator.py`
- Created and pushed repository `alx_be_python` to GitHub.
- Practiced Git & Git Bash workflows (clone, add, commit, push).
- Practiced copying files between drives and directories on Windows using Git Bash.

---

## 🏆 Achievements
- First successful GitHub repository and initial push: https://github.com/amrhazard15/alx_be_python
- Implemented and tested 6 Python scripts for the course exercises.
- Created a structured project folder: `python_introduction/`.
- Gained confidence running Python scripts and handling file operations across drives (E:\).

## 🔥 Challenges & Learnings
- **cp command pitfalls in Git Bash:** I initially missed the destination argument and learned to use `cp "source path" .`.
- **Git workflow detail:** I learned to always run `git status` and `git add .` before committing.
- **Type conversions & input handling:** `input()` returns strings — convert to `float()`/`int()` when needed.

## 🌟 Monthly Highlights
- Completed first month of ALX Back-End program 🎉.
- First time pushing a fully structured repo with multiple exercise scripts.
